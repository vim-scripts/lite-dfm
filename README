A lightweight plugin to remove distractions from Vim.

This is based loosely on Distraction Free Mode in Sublime Text.

A key differentiator from most other implementations of distraction free writing in Vim is that support for vsplits remains uncrippled. This comes at the expense of proper centering, though, so there&#039s a tradeoff.
